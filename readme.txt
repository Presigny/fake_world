"check_border_cities_random.py": it is a sanity check to see if the borders of the country match well
the cities inside it and that the generation of random points

We see that Italy and France have two point correlation distribution that look like random...
Anyway we cannot fit the Soneira-Peebles model on them at least theoretically
Maybe we can prove at short distance it is a lognormal distribution...
I need to produce some Soneira Peebles and fit them on the France or Italy to see if it still doable
